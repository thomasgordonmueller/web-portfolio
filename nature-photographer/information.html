My formal photos typically include family groupings, bridal party, and bride and groom portraits. Bride and groom time is very laid back and fun. We will walk around to a few neat locations and snap photos. I will take some candids and posed shots here and there of the two of you. I will help you make a plan a few weeks prior to your wedding day of what photos you want and at what time. I am also here to help you with any scheduling questions as soon as you book.</span>

While other photographers may add many different unnatural color effects to their clients’ images, I like to maintain the quality and realistic look for my clients. I want your photos to last the test of time and not just the current trend. I spend a lot of time making sure your wedding photos have the correct colors, exposure, and ready for printing as soon as you get them. You will notice in my portfolio that everyone looks natural and not ‘over edited’ which is what I strive for. You will also receive rich black and white versions of each of your photos.</span>

      <p>“John Smith has set the standards for a whole generation of wildlife photographers,” according to the BBC. “Mr. Smith’s photographs take creatures that have become ordinary and transform them into haunting new visions,” writes acclaimed field biologist Dr. George Schaller in The New York Times. “As a chronicler of natural history today, Frans Lanting is a singular, extraordinary talent,” says Thomas Kennedy, former Director of Photography at National Geographic. “He has the mind of a scientist, the heart of a hunter, and the eyes of a poet.”</p>

            <h2>About John Smith</h2>
            <p>I have been a photographer since 2007 and I love it. I do family, seniors, and commercial photography but I enjoy wedding photography the most. I do around 50 shoots per year. I feel like I connect well with people who don’t like to be in front of the camera so I am able to get them comfortable and excited. My wife and I enjoy traveling the world. So far we have been to 7 different countries. We are always planning our next adventure because life is too short and the world is too big to stay in one place.</p>
